2. First, shout out any jutsu name loud and clear. (Please refer [Speech Text](/getting-started/speech) page)
3. After speech text is identified correctly, perform the required hand signs as mentioned in [Jutsu](/getting-started/jutsu) page.
4. If handsigns are performed correctly, jutsu should be detected. (Jutsu is diplayed at the footer of video)

:::note
For the handsigns to be detected correctly, please make sure to be in a **well lit environment** and perform all the handsign below neck-level as the model was trained in these conditions.

:::caution
Shinobi Code needs access to webcam video and mic audio.<br></br> 
Please see [Disclaimer](/others/disclaimer) page to understand how we process your video and audio. Dont' worry, we don't.
