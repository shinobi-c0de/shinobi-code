## Permission
Shinobi Code needs the following media access to function properly:

1. Video from Webcam - used to detect the hand sign. (processed locally)
2. Audio from Mic - used for Speech Recognition, sent to backend server for processing. (audio is not stored )

## Model
The HandSign detection model which is used in this project is a publically available model.
Thanks to the efforts of [Kazuhito](https://github.com/Kazuhito00) san.  
Read more about the model [here](/others/model).
