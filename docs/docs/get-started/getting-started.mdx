## Follow below steps, after visting the site

1. Click on the record button (Konoha Logo) to capture your speech and Handsigns.

<div>
    <img width="80%" src="/shinobi-code-button.png"/>
</div>

2. First, shout out any jutsu name loud and clear. (Please refer [Speech Text](/docs/get-started/speech) page)
3. After speech text is identified correctly, perform the required hand signs as mentioned in [Jutsu](/docs/get-started/jutsu) page.
4. If handsigns are performed correctly, jutsu should be detected. (Jutsu is diplayed at the footer of video)

::: info Note
For the handsigns to be detected correctly, please make sure to be in a **well lit environment** and perform all the handsign below neck-level as the model was trained in these conditions.
