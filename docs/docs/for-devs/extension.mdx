# Shinobi Code Extension

Our VSCode Extension is still in alpha stage and is unstable. We are pushing updates frequently to make it better.
This page describes the development state of the extension.

## Extension - Working

There are two buttons:

1. **Train** - Get a hang of all handsigns and jutsu before trying the extension (Jutsu data is not sent to extension).
2. **Enter Shinobi World** - The real deal, get the Jutsu data from webapp and triggers commands based on Jutsu recieved.
